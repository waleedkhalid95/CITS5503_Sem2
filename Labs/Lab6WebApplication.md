## Learning Objectives

1. Create a web app using Django
2. Implement nginx and load balance requests to it
3. Retrieve data from DynamoDB to display in the app

## Technologies Covered

* Ubuntu
* AWS
* AWS ELB
* RDS
* Python/Boto scripts

**NOTE**: please use your Linux environment – if you do it from any other OS (e.g., Windows, Mac – some unknow issues might occur)

## Background

The aim of this lab is to write a program that will:

[1] Understand the basis for a web architecture that incorporates scalability and security using ELB

[2] Familiarise yourself with the basics of programming using Django

## Set up an EC2 instance

### [1] Create an EC2 micro instance with Ubuntu and SSH into it

**NOTE**: Regarding your region name, find it in the table below based on your student number (If you cannot find your region name, it means you enrolled late and you should send an email to `cits5503-pmc@uwa.edu.au` requesting your region name.).

### [2] Install the Python 3 virtual environment package

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```
It is easier now if you change the bash to operate as sudo

```
sudo bash
```

### [3] Access a directory  

Create a directory with a path `/opt/wwc/mysites` and `cd` into the directory.

### [4] Set up a virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv myvenv
```

### [5] Activate the virtual environment

```
source myvenv/bin/activate

pip install django

django-admin startproject lab

cd lab

python3 manage.py startapp polls
```

**NOTE**: Stop and look at the files that have been created – the project files are to do with the running of the application. We will deal with the files as we go through.


### [6] Install nginx

```
apt install nginx
```

### [7] Configure nginx

edit `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` and replace the contents of the file with

```
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;

  location / {
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
  }
}
```

### [8] Restart nginx

```
service nginx restart
```


### [9] Access your EC2 instance

In your app directory: `/opt/wwc/mysites/lab`, run:

```
python3 manage.py runserver 8000
```

Open a browser and enter the IP address of your EC2 instance. Take a screenshot of what you see and stop your server with CONTROL-C


## Set up Django inside the created EC2 instance

### [1] Edit the following files (create them if not exist)

edit polls/views.py

```
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world.")
```

edit polls/urls.py 

```
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

edit lab/urls.py

```
from django.urls import include, path
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = [
    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

### [2] Run the web server again

```
python3 manage.py runserver 8000
```

### [3] Access the EC2 instance

Access the URL: http://\<ip address of your EC2 instance>/polls/, and output what you've got. 

**NOTE**: remember to put the /polls/ on the end and you may need to restart nginx if it does not work.

## Set up an ALB

### [1] Create an application load balancer

Specify the region subnet where your EC2 instance resides.

Create a listener with a default rule Protocol: HTTP and Port 80 forwarding.

Choose the security group, allowing HTTP traffic. 

Add your instance as a registered target.

### [2] Health check

For the target group, specify /polls/ for a path for the health check.

Confirm the health check fetch the /polls/ page every 30 seconds.

### [3] Access

Access the URL: http://\<load balancer dns name>/polls/, and output what you've got.

**NOTE**: When you are done, delete the instance and ALB you created.

## [Unmarked] Web interface for CloudStorage application

You need to create an AWS DynamoDB table copied from the local DynamoDB of the previous lab 3 as well as a copy of your AWS credentials.

In views.py, add boto3 code to scan the AWS DynamoDB table. Display the results in the calling page.

In Django, you can use a template to properly format a web page using supplied variables – you can do that to make the table look nice. To use a template, you need to create a folder called templates under polls and add to the TEMPLATES section of lab/settings.py

```
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [
            'polls/templates/'
        ],
```

In the templates directory, add a file files.html with the following contents:

```
<html>
<head>
    <title>Files</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Files </h1>


    <ul>
        {% for item in items %}
          <li>{{ item.fileName }}</li>
	{% endfor %}
    </ul>

</body>
</html>
```


Finally in views.py, you can pass variables from your DynamoDB call and render the template in the following way:

```
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.template import loader
from django.http import HttpResponse
import boto3
import json
from boto3.dynamodb.conditions import Key, Attr
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def index(request):
    template = loader.get_template('files.html')

    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb', region_name='ap-southeast-2',
                              aws_access_key_id='Your Access Key',
                              aws_secret_access_key='Your Secret')

    table = dynamodb.Table("UserFiles")

    items = []
    try:
        response = table.scan()

    except ClientError as e:
        print(e.response['Error']['Message'])
    else:    
        context = {'items': response['Items'] }

        return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))
```


You can add variables to the template and more formatting functionality to display the information correctly.
