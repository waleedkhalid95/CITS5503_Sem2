# Lab 6: Deploying a Django Web App with Application Load Balancer

## Summary
In this lab, I set up a Django web application on an EC2 instance and configured an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute HTTP traffic between instances for scalability and high availability. The main tasks involved creating the EC2 instance and security groups, installing and configuring a Django app, setting up nginx as a reverse proxy, and configuring the ALB with health checks to ensure the application is running smoothly. By the end of the lab, I accessed the Django application through the ALB's DNS name, confirming successful load balancing and web traffic distribution.

## Set up an EC2 instance

### [1] Create an EC2 Instance with Ubuntu and SSH into It
I modified the Python script used in Lab 2 to create an EC2 instance with both SSH and HTTP traffic allowed. The steps involve creating a security group, launching an instance, and connecting via SSH.
```python3
import boto3
import os
import subprocess
import time

# Initialize the EC2 client to interact with AWS EC2 services
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

# Step 1: Create a security group for the EC2 instance
security_group = ec2.create_security_group(
    Description='security group for development environment',
    GroupName='23803313-sg',
)
print(f"Security Group Created: {security_group['GroupId']}")

# Step 2: Authorize inbound traffic for SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80)
ec2.authorize_security_group_ingress(
    GroupName='23803313-sg',
    IpPermissions=[
        # Allow SSH traffic on port 22
        {
            'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
            'FromPort': 22,
            'ToPort': 22,
            'IpRanges': [{'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'}]  # Open SSH to all IPs for development
        },
        # Allow HTTP traffic on port 80
        {
            'IpProtocol': 'tcp',
            'FromPort': 80,
            'ToPort': 80,
            'IpRanges': [{'CidrIp': '0.0.0.0/0'}]  # Open HTTP for web access
        }
    ]
)
print(f"Inbound SSH and HTTP traffic authorized for {security_group['GroupId']}")

# Step 3: Create a key pair for SSH access
key_pair_name = '23803313-key'
key_pair = ec2.create_key_pair(KeyName=key_pair_name)
key_file_path = f'{key_pair_name}.pem'

# Save the private key to a file and set secure permissions (chmod 400)
with open(key_file_path, 'w') as file:
    file.write(key_pair['KeyMaterial'])
os.chmod(key_file_path, 0o400)
print(f'Key pair created, saved to {key_file_path}, and permissions set to 400')

# Step 4: Launch the EC2 instance with Ubuntu AMI and created security group
instance = ec2.run_instances(
    ImageId="ami-0a70c5266db4a6202",  # Ubuntu AMI for the ap-northeast-3 region
    SecurityGroupIds=[security_group['GroupId']],
    InstanceType='t2.micro',  # Free-tier instance type
    KeyName=key_pair_name,  # Use the created key pair for SSH
    MinCount=1,
    MaxCount=1
)

instance_id = instance['Instances'][0]['InstanceId']
print(f'EC2 Instance Created: {instance_id}')

# Step 5: Tag the instance with a recognizable name
ec2.create_tags(
    Resources=[instance_id],
    Tags=[{'Key': 'Name', 'Value': '23803313-vm2'}]  # Name tag for easy identification
)
print(f'Tag added to instance {instance_id}')

# Step 6: Retrieve the instance's public IP address for SSH access
response = ec2.describe_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
public_ip = response['Reservations'][0]['Instances'][0]['PublicIpAddress']
print(f'Public IP Address of the instance: {public_ip}')

# Wait for the instance to initialize and be ready
print('Waiting for the instance to initialize...')
time.sleep(240)  # Wait for 4 minutes to allow instance initialization

# Step 7: Connect to the instance via SSH using the generated key and public IP
ssh_command = f"ssh -i {key_file_path} ubuntu@{public_ip}"
print(f'Connecting to the instance via SSH: {ssh_command}')
try:
    subprocess.run(ssh_command, shell=True, check=True)  # Execute the SSH command
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Failed to connect to the instance: {e}")
```
**Explanation**:
- **Security Group Creation**: I created a security group to allow both SSH and HTTP traffic. This is crucial for remotely managing the instance (SSH) and serving the Django application (HTTP).
- **Key Pair**: The script generates a key pair for secure SSH access, saves the private key locally, and restricts access to it using `chmod 400`
- **Launch EC2 Instance**: An EC2 instance is created using the Ubuntu AMI. I associated it with the security group and key pair, and tagged it with a name for identification.
- **Public IP**: I retrieved the public IP of the instance, which is required for SSH access and to later access the Django app.
- **SSH Connection**: The script attempts to SSH into the instance using the private key and public IP.

Once the instance was up and running, I confirmed its creation in the AWS console:

### [2] Install Python 3 Virtual Environment
After connecting to the instance, I updated the instance and installed the necessary Python 3 virtual environment package:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fb98d38-9b62-433b-b3d5-cb92af715886)

I encountered some issues during the upgrade due to outdated libraries, which required restarting certain services:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/806c061f-7be5-4399-b109-5a652dd94678)

### [3] Create Project Directory and Set Up Virtual Environment  

I then created the project directory, `/opt/wwc/mysites`, and set up a Python virtual environment inside it:
```bash
sudo bash  # Switch to root
mkdir -p /opt/wwc/mysites  # Create the project directory
cd /opt/wwc/mysites
python3 -m venv myvenv  # Create virtual environment
source myvenv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
```

### [4] Install Django, Create Django Project, and Django App
Inside the virtual environment, I installed Django, started a new Django project called `lab`, and created an app called `polls`:
```bash
pip install django
django-admin startproject lab
cd lab
python3 manage.py startapp polls
```
I checked the contents to ensure everything was set up properly:
```bash
ls -l
```

## Setting Up nginx as Reverse Proxy

### [5] Install nginx
To handle incoming HTTP requests and forward them to the Django app, I installed nginx:
```
sudo apt install nginx
```
### [6] Configure nginx
I edited the nginx configuration file to set it up as a reverse proxy that forwards traffic from port 80 to the Django app running on port 8000:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```
Replace the file content with:
```
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;

  location / {
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
  }
}
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e3b8111-51eb-4642-b02d-a276a9f1e2e4)

This configuration ensures that any traffic received on port 80 is forwarded to the Django app running locally on port 8000.

### [7] Restart nginx
After editing the configuration, I restarted the nginx service to apply the changes:
```
service nginx restart
```

### [8] Access the EC2 Instance

After restarting nginx, we need to run the Django development server to serve the web application. To do this, I navigated to the Django project directory and executed the runserver command:
```bash
cd /opt/wwc/mysites/lab
```
This is where the Django project is located.
Then Run the Django development server on port 8000:
```bash
python3 manage.py runserver 8000
```
This command starts the Django web server locally, binding it to port 8000. The application will now be accessible through nginx, which proxies requests from port 80 (public HTTP) to port 8000 (Django).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59e6cb3c-aa4a-4715-9f28-5921fa6628b8)

Open the browser and enter the public IP address of the EC2 instance to verify the setup. The IP address can be retrieved from the AWS console or via the output from the earlier Python script. Once entered into the browser, nginx forwards the request to Django, and the app is displayed.

## Setting Up Django Application

### [1] Editing Django Files
After installing Django and creating the `polls` app, I proceeded to modify the necessary Django files to handle HTTP requests and display simple content. This involves creating views, URL patterns, and routing.

#### Editing `polls/views.py`
First, I needed to create a view that returns a basic HTTP response.
```bash
nano polls/views.py
```
In `polls/views.py`, I added the following code:
```python3
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world.")
```
**Explanation**:
- I imported the `HttpResponse` class from `django.http` to send back an HTTP response when the view is accessed.
- The `index()` function takes an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response with the text "Hello, world." This will be the basic content displayed when we access the `/polls/` URL.
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db289496-0d65-406b-9ebc-a8dba65d2202)

#### Editing `polls/urls.py` 
Next, I needed to map the view to a URL pattern in the `polls` app.
```bash
nano polls/urls.py
```
In `polls/urls.py`, I added the following code:
```
from django.urls import path
from . import views  # Import the views from the same directory

# Define the URL patterns for the polls app
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),  # Map the root URL to the index view
]
```
**Explanation**
- The `urlpatterns` list maps URLs to views. Here, I used the `path` function to route the root URL (`''`) of the `polls app` to the `index()` view we just created in `polls/views.py`.
- The `name='index'` is a URL name that can be referenced in templates or other Django components.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24579883-73a3-44e5-a46e-bb1207f0f5b4)


#### Editing `lab/urls.py`
```bash
nano lab/urls.py
```
In `lab/urls.py`, I added the following code:
```
from django.urls import include, path
from django.contrib import admin

# Define the URL patterns for the project
urlpatterns = [
    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),  # Include the polls app's URLs
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),  # Default admin URL
]
```
**Explanation**
- The `path('polls/', include('polls.urls'))` line includes the URL patterns from the `polls` app whenever the `/polls/` URL is accessed. This means that any URL beginning with `/polls/` will be handled by the `polls` app.
- The `admin/` path is the default Django admin interface URL.
-

### [2] Running the Django Web Server
Now that the `polls` app has been set up and the URLs are correctly routed, I ran the Django development server to test the application.
```
python3 manage.py runserver 8000
```
This command runs the Django development server on port 8000, binding the server to localhost. However, since we configured nginx as a reverse proxy, nginx will forward traffic from port 80 (HTTP) to port 8000 (Django).
### [3] Accessing the EC2 Instance
With the Django development server running, I accessed the application using the public IP of the EC2 instance and navigated to the `/polls/` endpoint. This verifies that the application is properly set up and working.

I opened a browser and entered the public IP, http://13.208.165.62/polls/, of the EC2 instance with the `/polls/` URL to verify changes

This resulted in the expected "Hello, world." message from the `index()` view.

## Setting Up Application Load Balancer

### [1] Creating an Application Load Balancer

To improve scalability and availability, I created an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming HTTP traffic between multiple EC2 instances.

I used the following Python script to create the ALB, set up a target group, register the EC2 instance as a target, and create an HTTP listener.

```python3
import boto3
import time

# Initialize EC2 and ELBv2 clients in the specified region
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='ap-northeast-3')
elbv2 = boto3.client('elbv2', region_name='ap-northeast-3')

# Step 1: Get Instance Details and Subnet IDs
# Use filters to find instances created with a specific key name and security group
try:
    response = ec2.describe_instances(
        Filters=[
            {'Name': 'key-name', 'Values': ['23803313-key']},
            {'Name': 'instance.group-name', 'Values': ['23803313-sg']},
            {'Name': 'instance-state-name', 'Values': ['running']}  # Filter for running instances
        ]
    )
    
    # Extract instance IDs and subnet IDs
    instance_ids = []
    subnet_ids = []
    
    for reservation in response['Reservations']:
        for instance in reservation['Instances']:
            instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
            subnet_id = instance['SubnetId']
            instance_ids.append(instance_id)
            subnet_ids.append(subnet_id)
            print(f"Instance ID: {instance_id}, Subnet ID: {subnet_id}")

    if not instance_ids:
        print("No running instances found.")
    else:
        print(f"Found {len(instance_ids)} running instance(s).")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while retrieving instance details: {e}")

# Step 2: Retrieve the Security Group ID
try:
    response_sg = ec2.describe_security_groups(GroupNames=['23803313-sg'])
    security_group_id = response_sg['SecurityGroups'][0]['GroupId']
    print(f"Existing Security Group found: {security_group_id}\n")
except ec2.exceptions.ClientError as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}\n")

# Step 3: Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
try:
    load_balancer = elbv2.create_load_balancer(
        Name='23803313-alb',
        Subnets=subnet_ids,  # Attach to the subnets of the running EC2 instances
        SecurityGroups=[security_group_id],  # Use the same security group
        Scheme='internet-facing',  # Publicly accessible load balancer
        Tags=[
            {'Key': 'Name', 'Value': '23803313-alb'}
        ],
        Type='application',  # Specify this as an application load balancer
        IpAddressType='ipv4'
    )
    lb_arn = load_balancer['LoadBalancers'][0]['LoadBalancerArn']
    print(f"Load Balancer created: {lb_arn}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while creating the load balancer: {e}")

# Step 4: Create a Target Group for the Load Balancer
try:
    instance_details = ec2.describe_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_ids[0]])
    vpc_id = instance_details['Reservations'][0]['Instances'][0]['VpcId']
    
    # Create a target group for the load balancer
    target_group = elbv2.create_target_group(
        Name='23803313-tg',
        Protocol='HTTP',
        Port=80,
        VpcId=vpc_id,  # Use the VPC of the instances
        HealthCheckProtocol='HTTP',
        HealthCheckPort='80',
        HealthCheckPath='/polls/',  # Specify the path for health checks
        TargetType='instance'
    )
    target_group_arn = target_group['TargetGroups'][0]['TargetGroupArn']
    print(f"Target Group created: {target_group_arn}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while creating the target group: {e}")

# Step 5: Register EC2 Instances in the Target Group
if 'target_group_arn' in locals():
    try:
        elbv2.register_targets(
            TargetGroupArn=target_group_arn,
            Targets=[{'Id': instance_id} for instance_id in instance_ids]
        )
        print(f"Instances registered to target group: {target_group_arn}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while registering targets: {e}")

# Step 6: Create a Listener for the Load Balancer
if 'lb_arn' in locals() and 'target_group_arn' in locals():
    try:
        listener = elbv2.create_listener(
            LoadBalancerArn=lb_arn,  # ARN of the load balancer
            Protocol='HTTP',
            Port=80,
            DefaultActions=[
                {
                    'Type': 'forward',
                    'TargetGroupArn': target_group_arn  # Forward traffic to the target group
                }
            ]
        )
        listener_arn = listener['Listeners'][0]['ListenerArn']
        print(f"Listener created: {listener_arn}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while creating the listener: {e}")
else:
    print("Load balancer or target group creation failed. Skipping listener creation.")

```
**Explanation**
- **Instance Details:** The script retrieves the details of running EC2 instances based on filters (key pair, security group, and instance state). This helps gather information such as instance IDs and subnet IDs.
- **Security Group:** The existing security group is retrieved to attach it to the load balancer for consistent access control.
- **Create ALB:** The Application Load Balancer is created with an internet-facing scheme, allowing public access. The subnets of the EC2 instances are associated with the ALB to distribute traffic across them.
- **Target Group:** A target group is created to hold the EC2 instances. It uses the `/polls/` path for health checks, ensuring the app is responsive before directing traffic.
- **Register Instances:** The EC2 instances are registered as targets in the target group. This ensures that incoming traffic is distributed among these instances.
- **Listener:** A listener is created to forward HTTP traffic from port 80 to the target group.

### [2] Health Check Configuration

For the target group, I configured the ALB to check the health of the EC2 instances by making a request to the `/polls/` endpoint every 30 seconds. If the response is successful, the instance is marked as healthy.

### [3] Accessing the Application via ALB
Finally, I accessed the Django app using the DNS name of the ALB. This confirms that the ALB is distributing traffic to the instances correctly and that the app is responsive.
