# Lab 5: Application Load Balancer with EC2 Instances

## Summary

In this lab, I configured an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute HTTP requests between two EC2 instances located in different availability zones within the `ap-northeast-3` region. Using Python and Boto3, I automated the creation of EC2 instances, set up a security group allowing HTTP and SSH access, and configured a load balancer with a target group containing the instances. After installing Apache2 on both instances and customizing the default web pages to display the instance names, I verified the load balancer's functionality by accessing its DNS name, which successfully routed traffic between the instances. This demonstrated effective load balancing and improved application availability.

## Application Load Balancer

### [1] Creating EC2 Instances and Configuring the Load Balancer

The goal of this task was to set up a scalable and resilient web application environment by distributing incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances using an Application Load Balancer. The steps involved included creating EC2 instances, configuring a security group, setting up an Application Load Balancer, creating a target group, and registering the instances in the target group.

Hereâ€™s the complete Python script:

```python
import boto3  # Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of Amazon services
import time   # The time module is used to add delays in the script for waiting on resource provisioning

# Initialize EC2 and ELBv2 clients in the specified region
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='ap-northeast-3')
elbv2 = boto3.client('elbv2', region_name='ap-northeast-3')

# Define parameters for EC2 instances and security group
ami_id = 'ami-0a70c5266db4a6202'  # AMI ID for a standard Linux instance in the ap-northeast-3 region
instance_type = 't3.micro'        # Instance type chosen for a balance of cost and performance
key_name = '23803313-key'         # Name of the SSH key pair for accessing the instances
security_group_name = '23803313-sg'  # Security group name to manage access rules

# Step 1: Check if the Security Group exists or create it if it doesn't
try:
    # Attempt to describe the security group by name to see if it already exists
    response = ec2.describe_security_groups(GroupNames=[security_group_name])
    security_group_id = response['SecurityGroups'][0]['GroupId']
    print(f"Existing Security Group found: {security_group_id}\n")
except ec2.exceptions.ClientError as e:
    # If the security group is not found, an exception is raised; check if it's due to a missing group
    if 'InvalidGroup.NotFound' in str(e):
        # Create a new security group for managing access to the instances
        try:
            security_group = ec2.create_security_group(
                Description='Security group for web and SSH access',
                GroupName=security_group_name
            )
            security_group_id = security_group['GroupId']
            print(f"Security Group Created: {security_group_id}\n")

            # Authorize inbound traffic rules for SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80)
            ec2.authorize_security_group_ingress(
                GroupId=security_group_id,
                IpPermissions=[
                    {

                    }
                ]
            )
            print("Inbound rules added to the security group.\n")
        except Exception as create_error:
            # Handle any errors that occur during the creation of the security group
            print(f"An error occurred while creating security group: {create_error}\n")

```
**Code Explanation**:
- **Security Group Check and Creation**: The script first checks if a security group named `23803313-sg` already exists. If not, it creates one with rules to allow inbound SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) traffic from any IP address. This is essential for managing access to the EC2 instances.
- **EC2 Instances Launch**: Two EC2 instances are launched in separate availability zones (`ap-northeast-3a` and `ap-northeast-3b`). This improves availability and fault tolerance by distributing the instances across different zones.
- **Load Balancer Creation**: An Application Load Balancer named `23803313-alb` is created using the subnets of the EC2 instances, making it accessible over the internet (`internet-facing`).
- **Target Group Creation**: A target group named `23803313-tg` is created within the same VPC as the EC2 instances. The target group is configured to route HTTP traffic on port 80 and includes health checks to ensure that the instances are functioning correctly.
- **Register Targets**: The EC2 instances are registered to the target group, enabling the load balancer to distribute incoming traffic to the instances.
- **Listener Setup**: A listener is created on the load balancer to listen for HTTP requests on port 80 and forward them to the target group.

We can check our AWS console and see that the instance is created

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9620cf6e-99da-403e-8765-a03b4758a389)

The load balancer is also created sucessfully

### [2] Test the Application Load Balancer

After setting up the load balancer, I tested its functionality by accessing each EC2 instance using their public IP addresses.
- Accessing Instances Directly: Checked public IP addresses for each instance:
  - Instance 1: `13.208.252.206`
  - Instance 2: `15.152.119.216`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3ee221e-4018-446f-97d6-c7d2fd87ad49)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35fd70e9-9826-44cc-9ad0-46675f9e3d53)

Initially, the load balancer did not work because Apache2 was not installed on the instances.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64253bb9-6f19-4c10-a0a6-248cd38a1e89)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff0ef7e6-9328-4f50-8896-50014283bff0)

To resolve this, I SSH'd into each instance and installed Apache2 to serve a basic web page.

### [3] Steps to Install Apache2 on EC2 Instances
1. **SSH into Each Instance**:
   Initially, I attempted to SSH into the instances using their IP addresses directly, but I received a permission denied error:
   ```bash
   ssh -i "23803313-key.pem" ubuntu@13.208.252.206
   ssh -i "23803313-key.pem" ubuntu@15.152.119.216
   ```
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13b24fb3-b026-4bc9-b2f0-7fe65b889031)
   
   To resolve this, I used the private key created earlier and the public DNS of the instances to connect via SSH:

   ```bash
   ssh -i "23803313-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-208-252-206.ap-northeast-3.compute.amazonaws.com
   ssh -i "23803313-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-15-152-119-216.ap-northeast-3.compute.amazonaws.com
   ```
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad76fc5e-2314-4577-bfc6-0861bd08023c)


2. **Update and Install Apache2**:
   Once connected, I updated the package lists and installed Apache2 to serve HTTP traffic:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt install apache2
   ```

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ee76eac-0ce1-45a3-bf63-21e12300c6ba)

3. **Customize Web Page**:
   I edited the `/var/www/html/index.html` file on each instance to display the instance name, confirming correct setup when accessed via the load balancer.

### Final Verification
- Accessed the load balancerâ€™s DNS name in a browser, and it successfully routed requests between the two instances, demonstrating load balancing functionality.

### Clean-Up
After verifying the load balancer's functionality, I deleted the EC2 instances and load balancer from the AWS console to avoid unnecessary costs.
